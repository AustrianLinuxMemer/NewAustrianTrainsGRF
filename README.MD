Due to the original "Austrian Trains" NewGRF resources that are unfortunatley no longer found. I took it upon myself to develop an alternative version of \"Austrian Trains\". thr reason i'm doing this is because the [Austrian Trains Develpment page](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?p=1215894) does have Github links, but unfortunatley, they are no longer valid and only present 404 error messages
